A collection of c++ projects for CS165 (advanced intro to programming)

curveCalc.cpp
Calculates area under a curve using Riemann Sums for a set of predefined polynomials.  
Allows user input for x-axis start/stop points.

tetrisMax.cpp
Populates a user defined dynamic two-dimensional array with random numbers.
then searches the matrix for the largest sum contained in one of the classic 'tetrominoes'.
Array is rotated 4 times then scanned through right to left/top to bottom with each of the 
tetromino shapes.  The result is the largest sum, its location and the rotation of the shape.
